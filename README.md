Pure CSS Resets
==================

No bullshit CSS resets, yet everything you need packaged for [Meteor](http://meteor.com).

(Attention: It's resetting the base font-size to 10px, thus using rem/em becomes easier in your project)

### Installation
Simply add via console
```sh
$ meteor add andmitsch:purecss
```
